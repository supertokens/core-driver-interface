# Core Driver Interface

This is the API spec that is exposed by the [SuperTokens core](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core) service.

It is meant to be consumed only by a backend client like a API layer or a webserver (i.e NOT a frontend client like a website client or a mobile app client).
